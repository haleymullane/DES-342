            <p>NEWSPAPER: <br />This newspaper stands in as an example of something that can ignite a flame. The first addition of a "stresser" is called Arousal; when a need is realized, such as hunger, rest, water, exercise, attention, etc.</p>

            <p>FIRE: <br />This phase of fire is in a relaxed state. All previous needs have been met, and the individual feels calm in their current state of being.</p>

              WATER: <br />
              This watering can represents things that can diffuse a fire. The fire will never be fully extinguished, but it can be controlled and supported. When you "water" an individual's fire, you are meeting their needs, or supporting them by redirecting them if the need cannot be immediately met.

              Adding this newpaper, or not meeting the needs of the individual may bring this flame to the final stage. Their level of tolerance has lowered, meaning not meeting a need or encouraging redirection can cause them unable to regulate their "flame".

              FIRE <br />
              This flame is in the "Arousal" state, has unmet needs, and the individual has grown more irritable. This can show itself as having some dismissive answers to questions, difficulty focusing, or lack of interest in their current activity.

              WATER <br />
              Adding water to this flame can help the individual regulate their emotions, allow them to focus more, engage with people around them, and solve problems more effectively.

              Adding this newspaper will only further add to the flame, and exacerbate the issue, and leave the flame as is. apply the newspaper to the fire.

              FIRE <br />
              The flame is at its full potential, and the individual has shut down. This can show itself by the person leaving the situation aggresively, yelling, or physical outbursts. The individual is no longer psychologically able to comprehend what the root of their problem or need is, and is unable to process logic under this distress.

              WATER <br />
              Adding water to the flame will not have the same affect as before. While it comes from a place of empathy, it also comes from logic based resolutions. The individual is no longer able to process rationally, or understand logic. Apply the water to the fire.
